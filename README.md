A simple Python script to rename multiple files in a folder with a chosen prefix and numbering sequence. Files are renamed based on their last modified time (oldest first). Perfect for organizing photo collections, scanned documents, or any file batch.

## ✨ Features
- 🔢 Rename files in bulk using a custom prefix and number sequence
- ⏳ Sorts files by last modified time (oldest → newest)
- 🎯 Optionally filter by file extension (e.g. only `.jpg`)
- 💻 Cross-platform (works on Windows, macOS, and Linux)
- 🎉 Easy to use – just run the script and follow the prompts

---

## 📋 Requirements
- 🐍 Python 3.x
- 📦 No external libraries required — only Python's built-in modules (os, os.path).  

---

🔒 Security Notes
- ⚠️ The script will rename files directly and overwrite names, so if something goes wrong, you might lose track of original filenames.
- 🚫 Avoid running the script on system folders or important directories to prevent accidental renaming of critical files.
- 🛡️ Use the file extension filter carefully to limit renaming only to specific file types you want to organize.
- 📝 This script does not support undo, so double-check inputs before running.
