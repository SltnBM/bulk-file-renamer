# 📝 Bulk File Renamer
A simple Python script to rename multiple files in a folder with a chosen prefix and numbering sequence. Files are renamed based on their last modified time (oldest first). Perfect for organizing photo collections, scanned documents, or any file batch.

## ✨ Features
- Rename files in bulk using a custom prefix and number sequence
- Sorts files by last modified time (oldest → newest)
- Optionally filter by file extension (e.g. only `.jpg`)
- Cross-platform (works on Windows, macOS, and Linux)
- Easy to use – just run the script and follow the prompts

---

## 📋 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required — only Python's built-in modules (os, os.path).  

---

## 🔒 Security Notes
- The script will rename files directly and overwrite names, so if something goes wrong, you might lose track of original filenames.
- Avoid running the script on system folders or important directories to prevent accidental renaming of critical files.
- Use the file extension filter carefully to limit renaming only to specific file types you want to organize.
- This script does not support undo, so double-check inputs before running.
